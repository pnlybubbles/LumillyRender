Martin Newell modeled this teapot using bicubic Bezier patches in 1975
as part of an entire tea set. It first appeared in his
Ph.D. dissertation. Jim Blinn scaled the teapot horizontally by 1.3x
to cancel the effect of the rectangular pixels on their display. The
original had no bottom; most variations add one. Kenzie Lamar at
Vicarious Visions created this version from the default teapot model
in 3D Studio Max. He resized the top so that it fits snugly, created a
shell and welded the spout and handle so that the teapot is a manifold
without boundary, and created a unique and consistent resolution texture
parameterization for the entire model.
